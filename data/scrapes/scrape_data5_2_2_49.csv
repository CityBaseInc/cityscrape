32`Home - City Attorney of San Francisco`http://www.sfgov.org/cityattorney`https://www.sfcityattorney.org/`City Attorney of San Francisco Dennis J. Herrera, City Attorney SAN FRANCISCO (May 1, 2018) — City Attorney Dennis Herrera announced today he is seeking $5.5 million in penalties from two property owners, who, after being caught in 2014 illegally running a de facto hotel in one building, returned to flouting the law and unlawfully rented out 14 other apartments on Airbnb. A motion filed today in San Francisco Superior Court seeks a $5.5 million penalty for Darren and Valerie Lee, a couple who earlier had evicted tenants using the Ellis Act from their property at 3073-3075 Clay Street and then unlawfully converted it into short-term rentals. Herrera sued the couple in April 2014 over that unauthorized conversion. The Lees settled in May 2015, agreeing to pay $276,000 and have a court-authorized injunction prohibiting them from maintaining any of their San Francisco properties as short-term rentals in violation of the law. The injunction covers at least 17 buildings with more than 45 units. However, a painstaking two-year investigation by the City Attorney’s Office has found that in just the first 11 months that the injunction was in place, the Lees violated it more than 5,000 times, booking more than $900,000 in short-term rentals and pocketing more than $700,000 in illicit revenue from 14 units. [Read more] City Attorney Dennis Herrera and Oakland City Attorney Barbara J. Parker filed separate lawsuits on behalf of their respective cities against the top five oil and gas companies, asking the courts to hold them responsible for the costs of the infrastructure necessary to protect their cities from the consequences of climate change caused by their massive production of fossil fuels.  On January 31, 2017 City Attorney Dennis Herrera filed a federal lawsuit against President Donald Trump and his administration for his executive order directing enforcement action against sanctuary cities and threatening to withhold federal funding from these cities. The suit claims that the order is unconstitutional and exceeds the president’s power. Five online suppliers that had been flouting both state and San Francisco law by selling illegal large-capacity magazines as “repair kits” to customers in California have agreed to a wide-ranging injunction that compels them to follow the law. The settlement agreement improves safety in California communities and ensures that rogue companies comply with the law.  In efforts to combat the affordable housing crisis in San Francisco, City Attorney Dennis Herrera has taken broad actions ranging from filing lawsuits against unscrupulous landowners like Academy of Art University to cracking down on affordable housing fraudsters.
