32`Home - City Attorney of San Francisco`http://www.sfgov.org/cityattorney`https://www.sfcityattorney.org/`City Attorney of San Francisco Dennis J. Herrera, City Attorney SAN FRANCISCO (May 1, 2018) — City Attorney Dennis Herrera announced today he is seeking $5.5 million in penalties from two property owners, who, after being caught in 2014 illegally running a de facto hotel in one building, returned to flouting the law and unlawfully rented out 14 other apartments on Airbnb. A motion filed today in San Francisco Superior Court seeks a $5.5 million penalty for Darren and Valerie Lee, a couple who earlier had evicted tenants using the Ellis Act from their property at 3073-3075 Clay Street and then unlawfully converted it into short-term rentals. Herrera sued the couple in April 2014 over that unauthorized conversion. The Lees settled in May 2015, agreeing to pay $276,000 and have a court-authorized injunction prohibiting them from maintaining any of their San Francisco properties as short-term rentals in violation of the law. The injunction covers at least 17 buildings with more than 45 units. However, a painstaking two-year investigation by the City Attorney’s Office has found that in just the first 11 months that the injunction was in place, the Lees violated it more than 5,000 times, booking more than $900,000 in short-term rentals and pocketing more than $700,000 in illicit revenue from 14 units. [Read more] City Attorney Dennis Herrera and Oakland City Attorney Barbara J. Parker filed separate lawsuits on behalf of their respective cities against the top five oil and gas companies, asking the courts to hold them responsible for the costs of the infrastructure necessary to protect their cities from the consequences of climate change caused by their massive production of fossil fuels.  On January 31, 2017 City Attorney Dennis Herrera filed a federal lawsuit against President Donald Trump and his administration for his executive order directing enforcement action against sanctuary cities and threatening to withhold federal funding from these cities. The suit claims that the order is unconstitutional and exceeds the president’s power. Five online suppliers that had been flouting both state and San Francisco law by selling illegal large-capacity magazines as “repair kits” to customers in California have agreed to a wide-ranging injunction that compels them to follow the law. The settlement agreement improves safety in California communities and ensures that rogue companies comply with the law.  In efforts to combat the affordable housing crisis in San Francisco, City Attorney Dennis Herrera has taken broad actions ranging from filing lawsuits against unscrupulous landowners like Academy of Art University to cracking down on affordable housing fraudsters.

Congratulations, your doors are open. Now you can focus on managing and growing your business. You’ve brainstormed and picked that perfect business name. So what’s the next step to make it legal and protect your brand? If you’re conducting business under a name different than your own (ie. John Doe), you must file a Fictitious Business Name (FBN) with the SF Office of the County Clerk. NOTEBe sure to register with the SF Office of the Treasurer and Tax Collector (TTX) before filing for a FBN. A fictitious name or trade name is a business name that is different from your personal name, the names of your partners, or the officially registered name of your LLC or corporation. Because the FBN allows you to Do Business As a name other than your given name, it is also called a DBA or DBA Name. When you choose to name your business, you must choose a name no one else in San Francisco is using. You can check to see if the name you want is available using the SF Fictitious Business Name (FBN) Search. We recommend searching the internet and checking the US Patent and Trademark Office or the CA Secretary of State’s Corporate Division to see if your name is being used in other areas as well.  To file your FBN, you must submit the Fictitious Business Name Statement and filing fee either in person or by mail to the SF Office of the County Clerk. If filing in person, be sure to bring: a valid legal photo identification; a self-addressed, stamped envelope; and proof of registration with TTX, (for example, a receipt or Temporary Verification of Registration). After filing for your FBN, you must advertise the name in a local newspaper for a minimum of four weeks. The name must be published in a legally adjudicated newspaper within 30 days from the date of filing. See the County Clerks publication requirements for more information.

You've chosen that perfect business name. So what's the next step to make it legal and protect your brand? Planning to build something new? Before you break ground, obtain a building permit to make sure you meet building and fire codes. A business that is accessible to all not only helps your customers, it’s the law. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and state regulations require that businesses be open to people with disabilities. Find and submit permits, licenses, and forms that apply to your business.  Hiring your first employee is a big step and introduces new complexities. As an employer, you must consider labor regulations and payroll taxes at the local, state, and federal levels. Congratulations, your doors are open. Now you can focus on managing and growing your business. Making your business accessible to people with disabilities not only serves your customers, it’s the law. By making accessibility changes you can meet federal and state requirements, as well as open up your business to a larger clientele.   Both Federal and State law prohibit discrimination against people with disabilities. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a Federal civil rights law designed to ensure equal access, full inclusion and participation for people with disabilities or impairments. In addition, the State of California has its own disability rights laws, codes and regulations. Under both Federal and State law, people with disabilities are entitled to full and equal access to places of public accommodation, transportation carriers, lodging places, recreation and amusement facilities, and other business establishments where the general public is invited. Together, these laws protect Americans’ civil rights, but while people often refer to both Federal and State laws as “the ADA laws,” there are important differences. The Federal ADA regulations require that all new construction for public accommodations comply with the 2010 Americans with Disabilities Act Standards. In addition, the ADA says that a public accommodation has a continuing obligation to remove architectural barriers (barrier removal) to make sure your business is accessible, even when your business is not otherwise contemplating construction. This includes existing barriers at entrances, aisles, bathrooms, and service counters that may have predated the ADA and your ownership of the business. The California’s Disabled Persons Act goes further, and makes a violation of the Federal ADA a violation of California civil rights law, and allows people with disabilities to sue a violating business to recover monetary damages. The California Building Code lays out specific ways to make your business accessible, but only requires that business owners make improvements whenever they are doing construction or renovation, typically under a building permit. If you renovate your building, then all of your new construction (the area of remodel) must meet the accessibility standards. In addition, you may be required to update some or all of the building’s main entrance, the primary route to the renovated area, and any bathrooms, drinking fountains, or signs serving the area of remodel accessible (path of travel and other features serving the area of remodel). If the cost of your construction project is under the state valuation threshold, you are allowed to limit the costs of your improvements outside of the area of remodel to 20% of your construction costs. This valuation threshold changes every year. Note If your project is valued over the threshold, and you are limiting your improvements outside the area of remodel to 20% of your construction costs, you must obtain approval from the SF Department of Building Inspection to show technical infeasibility or unreasonable hardship. This may not exempt you from litigation on the basis of Federal and State disability requirements. Building inspectors do not conduct a full review of your business location for disability access deficiencies; they only check to see if the renovations covered by your building permit meet the level of accessibility triggered under the building code for that specific project. And as discussed earlier, smaller projects are allowed an exception under the 20% rule and may not result in a fully accessible facility. However, even though the California Building Code requires that businesses make accessibility improvements only when they are doing other construction or renovation, your entire business location must still comply with the ADA barrier removal requirements. The only defense for your business not being fully accessible is if the necessary improvements are not currently readily achievable. Readily achievable means easily accomplishable and able to be carried out without much difficulty or expense. To fall under this exception, you must be able to legally prove that any improvements you did not complete were not readily achievable. Even if you do not complete all improvements, you are still required to make an effort to provide goods and services to people with disabilities. Note It can be very difficult for a business to claim either of these exemptions, and you should consult with a CASp and an attorney before relying upon either of them to protect you from a lawsuit. You have an ongoing obligation to make your business accessible. Even if changes are not readily achievable now, they may be in the future. To address this ongoing obligation, you should make a plan with a Certified Access Specialist (CASp) inspector (see below). Note Landlords are required to make public restrooms and ground-floor entrances/exits accessible, or give you notice if the space may not be ADA compliant. You can hire a professional Certified Access Specialist (CASp) to evaluate your location. The CASp inspects your location and provides a report. The report either certifies that you have complied with state and federal disability access laws, or explains the steps necessary to achieve full compliance. As part of this inspection you can work with your CASp inspector to develop a timeline for removal of all readily achievable barriers to access.  If you are sued in a state court for not being accessible, having a CASp inspection report makes you eligible to request a 90-day stay of the lawsuit and an Early Evaluation Conference.  You may also qualify for a 90-day stay if you have a final job card from a CASp-certified building inspector, or are a small business with 25 or fewer employees and gross receipts of less than $3.5 Million. Consult with an attorney to determine the best strategy to protect you and your business in the event of an ADA lawsuit.  Although working with an attorney can be expensive, some low-cost legal services are available to small businesses. ADA lawsuits commonly cost small businesses tens of thousands of dollars in legal fees and settlements – invest in your business by investing in access.

When you unregister your business with the City, you must inform the Office of the SF Treasurer & Tax Collector (TTX) that you have either closed or sold your business by deactivating your Business Registration Certificate. Click here to learn more and update your business information. If you have employees and pay over a certain amount in payroll, you must submit a final Payroll Tax Statement with payment to TTX.  When closing, selling, moving within the San Francisco County or out of the county, you must notify the Office of the SF Assessor-Recorder by filling out the Request for Business Account Closure. When closing your business, unregistering, also called abandoning, your FBN is optional.

To submit your payroll taxes, file a Payroll Tax Deposit and Quarterly Contribution Return and Report of Wages along with payment to the CA Employment Development Department (EDD) within ten days of closing your business. Learn more about the closing requirements from the EDD.  Whenever you sell or close a business that obtained a seller’s permit, you need to close out your account with the CA Board of Equalization (BOE). If your business is a corporation or a limited liability company, you may be asked to pay any unpaid taxes, interest and penalties. The BOE has created a Closing Out Your Seller’s Permit guide and provides additional instructions online to help you navigate this process. Whenever you close or sell your business, you must report it to the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and, if you have employees, you must follow US Department of Labor (DOL) regulations for your business and your staff.  When you close or sell your business, you must file final employment tax returns with the IRS. You also must file returns to report disposing of business property, to report the exchange of like-kind property, and/or to change the form of your business. The IRS Closing a Business guidelines provide all the information you need to close, sell, or declare bankruptcy for your business with the IRS.  If you have employees, be sure to follow US Department of Labor (DOL) regulations. The DOL instructions for downsizing and closing explain the federal rules for laying off employees, and offer services to assist you through a layoff as well as plan for and avoid future layoffs.

View all in My Folder Rather than start from scratch, consider purchasing an existing business. Plan, research, and choose wisely – it takes just as much prep work to buy a business as it does to start one. Last modified date: Mon, 08/04/2014 - 16:16 Not sure what type of business you’d like to buy? Start your research by contacting a local business broker or exploring online business broker sites. Thoroughly investigate your options and prepare just as if you were starting up your own idea: create a plan, register the business, and consider location and financing.  Examine revenue and costs closely. For example, if you are purchasing a restaurant, look at food and beverage sales, labor costs, and food costs. Look at these numbers by month and by year and check averages. Also examine the cost of utilities, rent, insurance, and taxes. If the current owners owe a mortgage on the business, you need to include that cost in your business plan too.  If an owner is reluctant to show you their books, don’t proceed any further. If they are serious about selling, they should be ready to give a clear picture of the financial health of their business. Keep in mind you may need to sign a nondisclosure agreement (NDA), promising you will not share their information with any other parties. A Dun & Bradstreet credit report on the company can help you evaluate its track record and double-check its reported numbers. A due diligence package includes past tax returns, any significant contracts the company has signed (including office of store leases) and any employee or contractor agreements. It also includes legal documents, such as filings, articles of incorporation and any past or pending lawsuits the company is involved in.  Unless you are very familiar with the business for sale (you either worked there or frequented it regularly) you should find out if the location has been profitable for the existing business. Is it visible enough to bring in foot traffic? Is there enough parking to encourage business? If the space is rented, then you must speak with the landlord about rent and find out if the cost will increase. Decide if you want to buy the business, along with the name and logo, or just the space and equipment. If you don’t plan to make any big changes, at least in the beginning, then it may be easiest to keep the current name. If the original owner plans to abandon the company’s fictitious business name with the Office of the County Clerk, they must obtain a Temporary Verification of Registration from the Office of the Treasurer & Tax Collector indicating the business closing date.  If you’ve decided to buy the business, you must obtain either a receipt from the Office of the Treasurer and Tax Collector (TTX) showing that all of the seller’s taxes on the business have been paid, or a certificate stating that no amount is due. This is required even for voluntary transfers of ownership where no form of currency or payment is exchanged, meaning the owner is giving you the business rather than you paying for it. If the business owes taxes, the buyer must include the amount in the purchase price and pay the money owed to TTX. Otherwise, the buyer becomes personally liable for the amount of taxes, interest, and penalties owed on the business. Most  industries have a standard method for valuing a business that uses a multiple of the previous year’s revenue. If the business has a lot of capital equipment (a manufacturer, for example), the market value of the equipment is taken into account as well. Fast-growing businesses in attractive markets are usually valued higher, as future potential is factored into the selling price.

Start here to learn more and get connected to those that can help you. The Small Business Administration (SBA) has a short tutorial to help you understand what it takes to do business globally. The SBA provides free online export training. You should also complete this questionnaire, which will help you get more information about your exporting needs. For more information, the International Trade Administration provides an export education guide to walk you through everything you need to consider for exporting. There are many important things to consider when you begin your efforts to expand internationally, and it is essential to develop an export business plan that defines your goals, objectives, and strategies. The Small Business Administration has a free export business planner that can help you start designing your approach to selling your business to the world. As you develop your plan, contact the U.S. Commercial Service to speak with a trade specialist who can offer to help you further improve your export strategy. Additionally, the San Francisco Small Business Development Center can connect you with an export consultant with knowledge about exporting and expansion. Consider how your company will plan to finance this new operation. The Small Business Administration has information on export loans, and San Francisco has several loan options to consider as well. The International Trade Administration also has information about export financing for you to review as you continue to develop your plan. You should carefully analyze what geographies would be the most advantageous to your business. Start by researching where the best opportunities exist for your type of business. The International Trade Administration’s Market Intelligence provides you with country-specific information that will help you get an understanding of various markets' opportunities and challenges. To learn more about the economy and demographics of countries around the world, the World Factbook has regularly updated information that will aid in your research. San Francisco has several programs that focus on three key geographies: Latin America, China, and Asia. For more information about exporting to these regions, visit LatinSF, ChinaSF, and SFAsia. The Office of Economic and Workforce Development provides resources for you to consider as you conduct your analysis of different markets. Once developed, review your plan with experts. Contact the San Francisco office of U.S. Commercial Service to discuss your exporting plans. The Export Legal Assistance Network will provide legal consultation once you have developed your plan and spoken to the U.S. Commercial Service. As part of your strategy, you should visit your desired foreign market(s) to connect with your future buyers and partners. One avenue to help you connect with overseas partners is to join a trade mission. Export.gov has a schedule of upcoming trade missions that you may want to look into. BusinessUSA has a calendar of events and trade missions that you should explore as well. Assistance is available with connecting your business with overseas partners through Export.gov's Gold Key Matching Service.

View all in My Folder You’ve explored the Business Portal, but you may have additional questions. We’ve answered some of the most common ones below. If you don’t find the answer you’re looking for you can always contact us. Last modified date: Tue, 02/09/2016 - 15:14 What is the San Francisco Business Portal? The San Francisco Business Portal is a City and County of San Francisco website, and your first stop for all things business. The Portal cuts through the red tape to help you navigate the process of starting, managing, and growing your business. Do I have to be a San Francisco resident to use the Business Portal? No, everyone is welcome to use this site, though it was created with San Francisco residents in mind. If you’re a resident of another city but would like to re-locate your business to San Francisco, the Portal can help. Is there a way for me to stay informed about new legislation and business requirements? The San Francisco Office of Small Business (OSB) maintains a newsletter thatprovides updates on news, legislation, and events related to small businesses. You can sign up for the newsletter through the OSB website. I'm not ready to submit any applications. How can the Business Portal help me? We recommend starting with a Starter Kit. Browse these step-by-step guides to help you open the most common types of businesses. There are tips and tricks to help you avoid common pitfalls, find resources, and identify all the permits that could be applicable. Create an account so you can save Starter Kits and other documents as you do your research. Come back at anytime and access all your information in 'My Folder'. When you are ready to open your business, you can submit the necessary application forms online through 'My Folder'. What's new on the Business Portal? We launched the Business Portal in November 2014 and keep looking to improve this critical digital service in San Francisco. We update this answer whenever we launch major updates.January 2016 - Now submit many permit applications online! Using the improved My Folder, you can save and digitally complete your applications, upload them to My Folder, and submit them online. You will still need to mail a check to pay for the permit fee, but we're working to change that, too! Learn How to Submit Permit Applications Online today.November 2014 - Business Portal launches! Now find all the information you need to run your business in one place. Here is more information on the launch and some awards the Portal has won. How do I submit permit applications online? 1) Create a free Business Portal account. 2) Add a Starter Kit or a Permit to 'My Folder'. 3) Find the permit you want to submit in 'My Folder'. 4) Download the form on your computer, complete the form, and save it. 5) Upload the completed form to the same place in 'My Folder'. 6) If there are additional documents required (e.g., copy of a check, proof of insurance, etc.), be sure to upload those, as well. 7) Click on the appropriate icon to submit. What is 'My Folder'? 'My Folder' is where you can save application forms and submit them when you’re ready. Does my old 'My Folder' still exist? Yes, it does! However, you will need a Business Portal account to access it. You can always add Starter Kits, Guides, Permits, and Documents to 'My Folder' for your reference later. Anything you add to 'My Folder' will be automatically saved until you delete it yourself. As part of the 'My Folder' upgrade, you can submit many permit application documents online! Simply save a form to your computer, fill it out, save it again, and upload it into 'My Folder' under the specific permit section. Why should I create an account? Creating an account on the Business Portal allows you to submit permit applications online, upload and save relevant files, and create checklists to track your progress. How do I create an account? 1) Click “Sign Up” on top navigation bar. 2) Enter your first name, last name, and email address. 3) Select a password that is at least 8 characters long with a number and special character. What is 'My Files'? Think of 'My Files' as a file cabinet where you can upload documents related to your business. What is 'My Checklists'? Check off your to-do’s using a pre-created checklist based on the type of business you are starting, or create your own custom checklist. What is the difference between a Checklist Template and creating my own? If you know the type of business you want to start (restaurant, food truck, hair salon, etc.), use a pre-created Checklist Template to track your progress. We added tasks based on the Starter Kits. You can add or delete items to Checklist Templates as you like. You can also create your own custom checklist to fit your needs better. How do I get started? 1) Find a Starter Kit for the type of business you want to open. 2) Familiarize yourself with all the steps involved. 3) Read all the instructions for each permit you need. Here is one for a Restaurant. 4) From the Starter Kits page, click on the button to “Add kit to 'My Folder'”. Are there any tips or tricks for my application? Absolutely: Each permit application has its own requirements. Be sure to carefully read all the instructions on the permit page, which you can find using the Permit Locator, before saving it it in 'My Folder' and submitting it online. No application is complete until the payment is received. Follow the instructions on submitting a copy of your check with your application and mailing the check to the appropriate permitting department. What if I have to make a payment? The Business Portal is working with each permitting department to establish online payments. While this is not yet available, we wanted to provide the convenience of submitting the application form online as a first step toward automating the entire process. Before submitting your form online and mailing in the check, scan an image of the check (with the department’s requested information), so you can upload this image to 'My Folder' with the application form. Your application is not complete until you have submitted the requested payment. Why can't I submit a payment online? The method of form completion, submission, and payment varies by form type and department. As we continue to enhance the functionality of the Portal, we are working with each department to automate as much of the licensing and permitting process as possible. Current instructions for form submission and fee payments can be found with each individual permit, or on the department websites. How do I delete my account? We're sorry to see you go! At the moment, you are unable to do this by yourself online, but we're happy to do this for you instead. Simply go to the Give Feedback page and request that we delete your account. If you don't mind, include a little message about why you'd like to delete your account. Perhaps we can do something to fix the issue!. What happened to the Enterprise Zone Tax Credits? As of January 1, 2014, the State of California has eliminated the Enterprise Zone program. Businesses have 10 years to claim any unused EZ credits, meaning that if you earned Enterprise Zone credits before 2014, you can use them up until 2024. Although you can no longer earn new credits, the state has created three replacement programs to help business owners. You can learn more from the SF Office of Economic and Workforce Development. What are ADA tax credits? Businesses can take advantage of two Federal tax incentives available to help cover costs of making access improvements for customers with disabilities: (1) A tax credit for small businesses who remove access barriers from their facilities, provide accessible services, or take other steps to improve accessibility for customers with disabilities. (2) A tax deduction for businesses of all sizes that remove access barriers in their facilities or vehicles. Does the City provide any loans or grants? The City provides a variety of loans and a very limited number of grants for specific uses to qualified businesses. The Invest in Neighborhoods team can guide you through these programs and explain how to qualify for them. What is 504 financing? Long-term commercial real estate financing with fixed, below-market interest rates and low down payments. The US Small Business Administration (SBA) and their partners offer 504 financing to help small businesses purchase fixed assets, like a storefront or equipment. How do I know if a location is ADA compliant? Because of the contention around disability access to buildings in California, there are Certified Access Specialists (CASp) who can assess your business for compliance with disability laws. Landlords must provide the Access Information Notice Brochure and Disability Access Obligations Notice to tenants at the time of lease execution or amendment for spaces 7,500 sq. ft. or less. Are there any improvements/changes I can make that do not require a building permit? A building permit is required for any work that is not specifically exempted by the Building Code. There are some changes that don't typically require a building permit, such as minor repairs to interior plaster, painting or wallpapering, floor coverings not requiring removal of existing flooring, replacement of doors, etc. You can find a full list of exempt changes in the DBI Getting a City Permit brochure but don't just assume your project is exempt. Be sure to check with the Department of Building Inspection. Visit the Zoning and Building section for more details on the process of obtaining building permits. How do I schedule an inspection? Every department conducts its own inspections at both the local and the state level. City requirements and state requirements are often different, so be sure to comply with both before any inspection. The San Francisco departments that most often sign off on building and location changes are the SF Department of Building Inspection (DBI), SF Fire Department, and, if you plan on serving food, the SF Department of Public Health (DPH). See our Zoning and Building section for more information. Can I start a business at a park? On the port? In the Presidio? On Treasure Island? The Presidio, Ocean Beach, Treasure Island, and all of San Francisco’s parks and piers are public property, but they are run by different agencies. If you want to start a business or operate in one of these locations, you must obtain permission from the appropriate agency. Some don’t allow business activity at all. For Ocean Beach and the Presidio, including Crissy Field, check in with the Golden Gate National Recreation Area. For public parks in the City, work review the Recreation and Park Department’s partnership opportunities and for port property, speak to the Port Authority. Finally, for leasing information on Treasure Island, contact the Treasure Island Development Authority. Do I have to be located in San Francisco to bid on a City contract? No, but all businesses must qualify to do business with the City before the City can award a contract or pay an invoice. Depending on the product or service you sell to the City, additional compliance requirements may apply. See our City Contracts section for more information. Does the City buy what I sell? The City buys everything needed to run our departments, including: office supplies, medical and laboratory products, water and electrical distribution systems, wastewater treatment equipment, buses, streetcars, cable cas, and products used in the maintenance and construction of buildings, roads, parks and playgrounds. See our City Contracts section for more information.. I don’t have time to think about preparing for disasters. Isn’t it enough to have insurance? Having insurance is great but have you thought about duplicating your insurance papers and other important documents so you can keep a set off site? This is only one of many things you can do to prepare for disasters. See our Disaster Preparedness section for more information. If a disaster strikes, who should I contact for help with rebuilding my business? There are a couple of places you can go for disaster relief: (1) File a Disaster Relief Application with the SF Office of the Assessor-Recorder. (2) The Office of Economic and Workforce Development (OEWD) can help provide access to various loan products that may also assist you in getting your business back up and running. (3) Get a Federal emergency loan of up to $2 million. Businesses affected by a federally-declared disaster can register with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and then apply with the US Small Business Administration (SBA). (4) Help your employees recover lost income.  Employees can apply to the CA Employment Development Department for benefits for work cancelled during and following a disaster. Are there labor laws that are specific to San Francisco? All businesses in San Francisco must comply with local labor ordinances, which are enforced by the Office of Labor Standard Enforcement (OLSE). These are the Minimum Wage Ordinance, Paid Sick Leave Ordinance, Health Care Security Ordinance, Family Friendly Workplace Ordinance, Commuter Benefits ordinance, and the Fair Chance Ordinance. These ordinances require that employers pay the SF minimum wage, provide paid sick leave, contribute to employee healthcare coverage, offer flexible work arrangements, and provide commuter benefits. Employers are also prohibited from discriminating against potential hires with criminal records. See our Hiring section for more information. How can I determine if a worker is an independent contractor or an employee? Sometimes employers improperly classify employees as independent contractors, which have different rules on payroll taxes, minimum wage, overtime, and other labor laws. Penalties my apply even if you are doing so unintentionally. The CA Department of Industrial Relations explains the difference. What happened to License123? The City and County of San Francisco had a pilot project with License123, allowing local business owners to use License 123 for free to access permit forms. However, as part of Mayor Ed Lee's Jobs Plan, this new portal was created to help make our city government more responsive and effective by providing a streamlined approach to accessing all business related information. The new San Francisco Business Portal now has a comprehensive searchable database of permits and licenses that was custom-built to meet the needs of San Francisco businesses. The Permits section of the portal contains detailed information about each permit, its requirements and dependencies, and is routinely maintained to ensure necessary forms are up-to-date. Can I fill out my forms or make payments online? For some permits, yes! However, the method of form completion, submission, and payment varies by form type and department. As we continue to enhance the functionality of the Portal, we are working with each department to automate as much of the licensing and permitting process as possible. Current instructions for form submission and fee payments can be found with each individual permit, or on the department websites. If you want a specific department to have online permitting, let us know in the Give Feedback section of the Portal. We look forward to working together with you to improve our City services. How do I start a Nonprofit Corporation? Most nonprofits are 501(c)(3) organizations, which means they are formed for religious, charitable, scientific, literary, or educational purposes and are eligible for federal and state tax exemptions. To create a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization, first you need to form a California nonprofit corporation. Then you apply for tax-exempt status from the IRS and the state of California. To form a nonprofit in California, first you need to form a nonprofit corporation under California state law. Once you have created your nonprofit corporation, you can obtain your federal and state tax exemptions. See nolo.com for more information on the state requirements.When these steps are complete, you must register your nonprofit with the SF Office of the Treasurer and Tax Collector. Nonprofit and other exempt organizations are exempt from the registration fee, payroll expense tax, and gross receipts tax, but must still register with the Tax Collector. They are also required to provide proof of their exempt status in order to receive an Exemption from Business Tax. If you need free or low-cost legal help as you file, the Bar Association of San Francisco’s Community Organization Representation Project (CORP) can help.

102`SFGOV |`http://tech.sfgov.org/`http://tech.sfgov.org/`       Skip to main content        As the technology leader and partner of choice, the San Francisco Department of Technology aims to improve government services, the community, and the lives of employees, residents, businesses and visitors of the City and County of San Francisco through smart and responsive use of technology. Expanding pervasive, high-speed broadband internet connectivity Modernizing government through digital service and product delivery Establishing best-in-class tools, methods and experiences for customers and modernizing infrastructure services Award-winning media productions for city government Adopting cybersecurity policy and framework to protect critical systems, data, and infrastructure The San Francisco Department of Technology defines Connectivity as the process of building and maintaining a constant connection between two or more points across multiple platforms. Connectivity is foundational for City business and public prosperity. The Connectivity Plan establishes the case for a municipal and managed fiber network, programs that work to expand fiber, optimization of #SFWiFi, and, perhaps most important, increased digital inclusion. We will build modern, sustainable digital products to better serve San Francisco residents, businesses, and visitors. DT announces this new service division to create digital assets and tools to modernize brick-and-mortar civic services. Our work creates online alternatives for a constituency that increasingly expects an app for that to satisfy their service needs. “Wi-Fi in our City’s parks is another step toward a larger vision of connectivity for our City as a whole, bridging the digital divide and ensuring that our diverse communities have access to innovation,” said Mayor Lee. “This project is a top priority for my administration because of the endless benefits that free Wi-Fi will bring to the residents and visitors of San Francisco. Thank you to Supervisor Farrell, Google and sf.citi for their truly innovative public-private partnership to connect our residents in new ways.”  Tweets by SFCityCIO  Tweets by DataSF  Tweets by SFMOCI

To easily turn ON JavaScript you can follow the instructions provided on the following websites: Enable JavaScript and WikiHow While it is not recommend soley using the Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF's) to deliver content on the Web, there are at times circumstances that require that content be provided in this format. Some of the reasons that PDF's should be used are for: These are valid reasons to use PDF's for electronic distribution. However, it is important to note that while the appearance of a PDF document may look like a readable document, it can be completely inaccessible to users who rely on assistive technologies. The appearance of headings and footers and blocks of text may undoubtedly make sense to a sighted individual who can discern the meaning of presentational styles of bold letters for headings and the appearance of bullets to create a list. However, if these documents were not developed with the appropriate use of headings, paragraphs, alt text for images and so on, the document can be inaccessible to users who rely on screen readers and other assistive technologies that interpret the literal formatting of content, not the intended formatting. If you will be creating an HTML version of the PDF, it is ideal to copy the content from the source document (such as MS Word) and pasting the content in a text editor (i.e., Note pad or Word pad) to strip out any formatting. Then copy > paste this content into the Content Management System (CMS) for formatting and publication. No matter which file format or application you will be converting your documents to PDF from it is important to make sure these documents are properly formatted prior to making the conversion to PDF. This means using only one level heading 1 per page, use the appropriate number of level 2 headings and if necessary, Level 3 sub-headings. Make sure paragraphs are formatted as such and use ordered and unordered lists appropriately. If you will be using images, make sure you apply alt text to the images if they are integral to understanding your content. When developing the content in your source document, it is important to bear in mind who your audience will be and to develop this content accordingly. This means developing your content for low-vision and no-vision users, users with cognitive impairments, motor-impairments, and users who may be deaf. To learn more about design considerations for these groups of users, visit the 'How do I design for Accessibility' page. After formatting your source document appropriately and after developing your content with your audience in mind, you will convert your document to PDF. If you marked up your content appropriately, the document should have applied the necessary tags required for screen reader accessibility...but don't bet on it. You must check the PDF to ensure that the tags have been appropriated correctly and in the correct order by following the steps in the next paragraph. If you are taking an existing PDF and making it accessible, you will undoubtedly need to follow the steps below (From Joe Clark's A List Apart article: Facts and Opinions about PDF Accessibility). Please note that different versions of Adobe Acrobat handle the creation and management of tags differently -so please refer to the Adobe Acrobat Accessibility page for instructions based upon your version of Adobe Acrobat. To handle the most common problems: 1. Adobe Accessibility Auto Checker 			Adobe Acrobat Standard 6.0 and higher comes with a Quick Check feature. However, this is fairly basic and you will need to test one PDF document at a time. 2. PAC - PDF Accessibility Checker 			Free PDF accessibility scanning tool recommended from W3C.http://www.access-for-all.ch/en/pdf-lab/pdf-accessibility-checker-pac.html 3. eGovMon 			Free PDF accessibility checker.http://accessibility.egovmon.no/en/pdfcheck/ Return to 'How Do I Design for Accessibility?' page                    - Service 24x7     City and County of San Francisco

Do I have to review the marriage license prior to solemnizing the marriage? 	Yes. The marriage license must be reviewed by the marriage officiant prior to solemnizing the marriage. Any person who solemnizes a marriage without first reviewing the license is guilty of a misdemeanor (Penal Code, Section 360). What statutes pertain to confidential marriages? 	Please visit California Legislative Information for the pertinent Family Code, Sections 500-511. Can I have more than two witnesses sign on my public marriage license? 	No. The public marriage license requires the signature of one witness, and if desired, has a place for an additional witness. No more than TWO witnesses may sign on the public marriage license. Only one signature per line is allowed. No witnesses may sign on the confidential marriage license. Can an ordained minister from another state perform a marriage ceremony in California? 	Yes. If they are authorized under Family Code, Section 400, out-of-state ministers may perform marriages. Does the US Supreme Court’s decision on Proposition 8 reinstate my 2004 San Francisco Same Sex marriage? 	In 2004, San Francisco Same Sex marriages were voided by the Court and are not valid.  The US Supreme Court's decision on Prop. 8 does not reinstate those voided 2004 same sex marriages.  Same sex couples are welcome to marry in San Francisco.  Marriage license and/or marriage ceremony appointment(s) and payment of current fees will be required. I was married in 2008 prior to passage of Proposition 8 banning same sex marriages in California.  Is my marriage legal? 	California Family Code 308 states: A marriage contracted outside this state that would be valid by laws of the jurisdiction in which the marriage was contracted is valid in this state.  (Repealed and added by Stats. 2014, Ch. 82, Sec. 6. Effective January 1, 2015.) What if we are currently California State Registered Domestic Partners (SRDP) and want to marry? 	A couple currently in a California SRDP together, are not required to dissolve their current California SRDP to marry.  By law, we cannot provide legal advice.  If the couple is unsure on how to proceed given the above information and/or has an out-of-state SRDP, they should consult a private attorney.

Depending on the requirement, the City uses various competitive procurement processes. Competitive bidding is the primary method for issuing solicitations. In general, solicitations will be requested through a document called a ""Low Bid Solicitation,"" Contract Proposal (CP), Request for Proposal (RFP), or Request for Qualifications (RFQ). Interested businesses should respond to the document by following the instructions detailed therein.
